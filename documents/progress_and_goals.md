### Goal for this semester  

- People:  

  ✔ Assigning a referee to a manuscript adds the referee role to that person.

  ✔ Only the editor and managing editor(s) have create / update / delete permissions for the accounts of others.  

  ✔ Advanced: record a history of each user's interacitons with the system.  

  ✔ A listing of all people is available, but only to the editor and managing editor(s).  

  ✔ A journal masthead can be generated from the database and displayed by the frontend.  

- Text:  

  ✔  These texts can be edited from the client application, but only by the editor and managing editor(s).  

- Manuscript:  

  ✔ Only the editor and managing editor(s) see all manuscripts; everyone else only sees "their own." That means manuscripts for which they are the author or referee.  

  ✔ A dashboard will present the manuscripts in visual form.
