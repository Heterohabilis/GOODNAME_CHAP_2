### Goal for this semester  

This semester our goal is to complete the journal website by using React to create frontend code using backend API, and add or change functionalities in the backend if needed.  


- People:  

  - Users can edit and delete their own accounts.  

  - Submitting a manuscript creates an account with the role of author  

  - Assigning a referee to a manuscript adds the referee role to that person.

  - Only the editor and managing editor(s) have create / update / delete permissions for the accounts of others.  

  - Advanced: record a history of each user's interactions with the system.  

  - A listing of all people is available, but only to the editor and managing editor(s).  

  - A journal masthead can be generated from the database and displayed by the frontend.  

- Text:  

  -  These texts can be edited from the client application, but only by the editor and managing editor(s).  

- Manuscript:  

  - Only the editor and managing editor(s) see all manuscripts; everyone else only sees "their own." That means manuscripts for which they are the author or referee.  

  - A dashboard will present the manuscripts in visual form.
